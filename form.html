            ProfileSome cricketers' rise to the top constitutes hours of perseverance and hardwork, 
            and others' include, predominantly, an abundance of talent and natural ability. 
            Abraham Benjamin de Villiers is that player you create in a computer game, who has both the attributes set to maximum, 
            and then some.de Villiers has risen through the ranks to become one of the world's finest batsmen, 
            most versatile batsmen, across all formats. When on song, de Villiers has the ability to take any bowling attack apart
            with his wide array of strokes on either side of the wicket. If his orthodoxy is compact and aesthetically pleasing,
            the South African avant-garde's trailblazing innovation often rendered bowlers speechless.
